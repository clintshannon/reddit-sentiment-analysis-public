What matters is your ability to consume requirements and produce results \*collaboratively\*. These are tools for creating things. Personal projects often look like ass next to professional projects, because professional projects have feedback from a bunch of people and are tweaked by senior/staff developers. If you haven't directly asked for contributing feedback for a personal project, it'll often look like a first draft to others. These flaws are often invisible to the initial author or too difficult to address for some time.

There are different programming languages that perform a variety of tasks, HTML and CSS are important in designing dynamic websites, JavaScript is important to power these websites, C is used in embedded systems programming, Python is used for artificial intelligence and data science, my point here is that programming as a whole and the many languages that help define it are nothing more than tools. They each have their own benefits and shortcomings and are specialized towards performing certain tasks. To state that one language is better than another is a mere immature naivety that you should pay no heed to. It’s as if I stated that a hammer was better than a saw. It makes no sense as they are each optimized and beneficial depending on the scenario in which you need them.

Maybe buy a book to grasp the basics or watch videos online, whatever suits you best. You will not understand everything you'll be doing at first, don't let that stop you from moving forward.

Some programmers need literal years of experience to grasp some programming concepts (some even never do !). So don't blame yourself for being a slow learner if you know programming is what you want.

Your friends sound like they themselves aren't very confident in their skills. If they did help you and you picked it up faster it would be discouragement for them to keep going by comparison.

But 'by comparison' is a dumb way to live, it's your programming journey. You decide what is a waste of your time and what isn't. Chances are they did learn CSS awhile ago and can't comprehend now how it's helped them see things differently.

yh6xn8,my friends put me down for learning how to code,2239,iucnntm,"First of all, lol. Just cut contact with people like this. Instead of discouraging each other, real friends will help one another to improve. The harsh truth is, they are not your real friends. Journey to the top and then being at the top is more often than not lonely, finding other people who want to get to the top with you and are sincere whilst you all are getting there is pretty rare, although not impossible. Anyways, whether you like it or not, it is what it is, the thing's called life.

Coming back to programming. While I strongly suggest one to learn C or even some Assembly, because it helps tremendously with understanding how all the higher level abstractions work in say JavaScript, it is not a must. You have to understand that it is not even about learning language X or language Y, it is about learning the concepts around language X or language Y. If you learn C or Assembly, you will also learn how CPU executes instructions, how the memory works in depth an so on, because those things are pretty much necessary to write good code in those languages. With JavaScript, HTML and CSS you will learn another spectrum of concepts, that will help you write good code that runs inside the web browser. With Python, you might learn about AI, which is another concept. I hope that you are getting what I am trying to say.

Another thing is, it doesn't matter whether you are good at thing X or not right now, what matters is that you get better every single day by not quitting doing that X thing. I fail every single day, does it mean that I should just stop, because I am not good enough ? No. Who knows, in the future I might create something that will help millions of people, if I quit now, I would never know. 

&#x200B;

TL;DR 

If you like programming, just keep on programming, don't quit because some people told you you're not good enough. Cut contact with those people and keep doing your own thing in peace.",4

Ok, that aside, let's break down a good 'path' for learning. HTML and CSS aren't programming, that much is correct. I think most people would recommend Python as a language to start with to grasp coding fundamentals, but Javascript is another good choice. C is not a good choice.

I'm new to programming myself (so I won't be able to help as much with certain things but I will try) and am taking the free Harvard course CS50. Guess what language we're (mooc students and actual Harvard students) starting with? Scratch. They use scratch to teach children! Plus many colleges have intro to programming courses that use Python as the main language. Everyone says Python is an easy language to learn. These facts alone lets me know using a hard language isn't necessary to learn programming.

They say the most important thing is to learn **programming logic** NOT syntax because when you know logic it's easier to learn programming languages and make better programs. So, focus on logic before syntax. The book I'm using is titled ""Introduction to Programming Logic and Design"" by the author Joyce Farrell. I'm only on the 3rd chapter but it's good so far.

Don't allow people to make you feel like a failure.

It's easy for us to think people are good at something we're new to). And always remember that everyone doesn't learn at the same pace. What took someone 1 day to get the hang of may take some of us 2 weeks.

I gave up because creating a videogame isn't only coding,but much more and it's really time/energy consuming. I just write some Python programs for my own needs when i need to ""automate"" something.

They're great friends for friends stuff, but oh, god damn, i would never like to work with them . Most people in coding have a superiority complex and need to show others that they're more intelligent/etc.

One of my friend is a software engineer and from time to time he randomly asks me to rate our friends' intelligence for no reason (i am not joking) , and that pisses me off also because i'm not that intelligent, so i feel judged too.

As a university student i also had experience with other computer science/software engineering students and god i've met very few people who didn't have a superiority complex and needed to show people he was better than others and made sneaky comments trying to put down people. I also had experience with students from other majors and i can confidently say that from my experience programming students are the one who are more likely to have a superiority complex.

That said, don't give up something if you like it, i wouldn't even tell you to change friends because maybe for friends stuff (games,hanging out,having fun etc.) they're great, but don't talk with them about coding stuff.

>I told them I'm learning about loops and functions and they told me that was easy stuff

Everything's easy once it becomes easy to you. That doesn't mean it was easy to learn in the first place.

&#x200B;

>I'm a noob and that it will get way more complicated from here and they don't think I'm cut out for coding because I ask them too many questions.

Yeah. You're a noob. Newbie. You're new to this. That's what learning is. If they mean that in a derogatory way, then they're just being stupid.

Asking questions is important to learn effectively. If you're asking a ton of questions and still not making any progress, it normally means you're missing some fundamental building blocks, or a working model of how the information you've learned actually applies to the real world.

As for getting more complicated, yes. It's like a videogame: every level is more difficult than the last, but as you level up you also become more capable of dealing with it. That's just what it means to make progress in *anything*.

&#x200B;

>I understand coding is really hard and I'm not the best coder but I showed them my webpage I made that I was really proud of but they all made fun of it and told me CSS will obviously never me my strong suit.

It's good that you were proud of what you made. It means you probably put a lot of work into it, and it was a demonstration and culmination of what you've been learning.

At the same time, It's worth noting that every parent has an ugly as hell painting on their fridge. But to the kid, that's a lot. To the parent, it's important to recognize it's significance. The same should be true for anyone who can do something, and those who are learning to do it.

(I'm replying a bit out of order here, excuse me)

>They tell me I shouldn't have learned HTML and CSS first because they aren't real programming languages but noob languages

Then I know people who've made millions with ""noob"" languages.

Raw HTML is a mark-up language; basically a format for storing and relating content. Kind of similar to XML in that sense. It widely isn't viewed as a *programming* language because it doesn't actually *do* much on it's own. CSS can be a bit more rich, because it's all about styling and explaining how to display said HTML content.

However, the real meat of web development tends to be the scripts: PHP, Javascript, etc. The things that are ""executed"".

&#x200B;

>They think Javascript is too hard for me and they told me if I'm interested in IT I should work helpdesk instead. I have been learning for 8 months and honestly I'm starting to believe them, I lost motivation to code because I feel like a failure. \[...\] I should have learned C but when I asked if they could help me learn it they all laughed and said if I'm struggling with javascript ill never stand a chance.

I dropped out of math in elementary grade 5, during long division. Then much later, I dropped out of highschool. Both in terms of academics and life, I've proven my lack of intellect; most people are more smarterer than me. Luckily, unlike you by the sounds of it, I've been blessed with great friends! One helped teach me my first language; C. It took me nearly a month to figure out how pointers work. That was certainly a low point... But now it's been nearly a decade and I write highly optimized C++ for time and resource constrained systems.

As I've mentioned; I lack the smart. Javascript is a hellish language for me.

While learning C, I also learned how computers work: processors, assembly instructions, native machine bytecode, the compiler toolchain, memory and cache, operating systems and kernels, all the different specifications and standards, and what the hell a 'programming language' even is ... It got to the point where I could write a line of low level code and actually imagine what the hardware would do to perform the operation I'm telling it to do. For me, that 'ground up' understanding was *extremely* critical for being able to learn how to program. I needed a more comprehensive understanding, with more information of how everything relates to everything else, before I would feel anything other than being utterly lost and confused. It was difficult but it was a foothold into something I was always curious about and wanted to learn.

[Javascript is pain](https://javascriptwtf.com/). I can actually use it a little now that I've become more familiar with code in general, but still: even compared to other high level languages, it's just an exorcise in self flagellation. At least for me.

**Conclusion, TL;DR, and the most important thing:**

>Am I just not cut out to learn code?

Let me rephrase this into two questions:

>Are I capable enough to learn to code to some significant level of proficiency?

Yes. If she was willing, I'm pretty sure I could even teach my grandmother how to program.

>Is learning to programming right for me?

I have no idea. That's a question only you can answer. Does your life situation permit it? Do you find it enjoyable? Do you like constantly learning and discovering new things? Do you like solving problems? Can you tolerate failure and being wrong a lot, while still pushing to improve? Then maybe.

yh6xn8,my friends put me down for learning how to code,2239,iug4vj0,"Here's a few of my thoughts.

They're right that you're learning beginner stuff. **Of course** you're learning beginner stuff. You're a beginner. You don't go from know-nothing to writing an operating system in eight months. You have to start with the basics. You can't skip them. And there's nothing wrong with your progress so far.

They say you're not cut out for it. Let me tell you this. I've taught several programming classes. Anybody can be cut out for it. It's true that some people naturally have a mindset that's more conducive to programming. If you're not one of those people, that's ok. You can still become one of those people. I've seen so many people come into it really clueless and then they have what I call an ""a-ha moment"" where it just clicks. Some people have that moment quickly; some after a year. But anybody who persists can get there.

CSS might not be your strong suit (or maybe it is, and they're douche-nozzles). It's not my strong suit. But I've been programming since I was about 10, thirty years ago, and I'm better at other things, and I'm a Principle Engineer at my company and make six figures. You don't have to be great at everything. Doesn't mean you shouldn't try.

They are **100%** wrong to tell you that you shouldn't start with HTML and CSS. Most people these days start there. It doesn't matter if it's not ""real programming"". Your giving instructions to the computer that it carries out, so who are they to say it's not real programming?

I've never learned C, but I'm one of the most respected developers in my company. HTML and CSS were my second and third languages.

So basically, your friends are jerks. If you want to be a programmer, go for it. Anybody can learn it if they give it enough time.

You're fine.",2

Don't stop learning, javascript or any other language for that matter is not difficult. I also thought the same thing before I learnt any programming language, now that I know one language and dabbled into others i feel once you get the basics right it would be very easy to learn other languages.

yh6xn8,my friends put me down for learning how to code,2239,iucr67q,"sounds like highschool mentality of ""I will feel better about myself if I put someone else down""

real friends would help you figure out stuff, tell you to ask them questions (though I'm not sure they'd be the best of help, at least it would be a kind thing)

I think it is easier to understand programming if you learn c. Not because it is true perhaps but because it is how I learned it and many others. It's kind of a myth passed on by practice. 

what you get with c is learning about memory. C has to allocate it's own memory and do everything you do in a lowlevel way. (for instance if you wan to find the length of a string in java I do: 

    String s = ""abc"";
    s.length; // this gives me the length (3)

in c you will be looping of the characters and counting until you find the 'end of string character'.

It's kind of like in kung-fu films where the apprentice runs up and down stairs with buckets of water. Yes it teaches stamina and obedience but it doesn't teach you the actual skills. But it's done because it has always been done.

So that said: it depends on where you want to go with coding. html and css aren't coding as such in the way that they are layout languages. ridiculously advanced though and definitely a separate expert niche that is valuable to learn. But those 2 won't teach you how to create new things. 

javascript however: you will learn quite a lot of coding using that. Some concepts far more advanced than c (I think from the beginning you'll be using an event system and such). you get to learn the same type of coding but you start at a high level. if you go to a low level language you might struggle but will you ever need it? It might just be water up and down a hill.",1

There's enough content on YouTube and the internet. You can be an awesome web developer if you believe in yourself and focus on learning than what your so called programmer friends tell you. 

As for programming languages. It's all logic, languages just structure these constraints differently depending on what use case and feature the Dev's keps in mind while building the language. Your friends saying that some programming language is more difficult says a lot about how much they actually know a out programming.

I've listened to all of the amazing coders who have helped me.  All gave me solid advice when I tried to tell them I should learn to code.  They told me a few things which were true.

A.  I don't need a coder, I have their support 
B. I wouldn't be able to handle the time it takes to ""get it"" because I'm impatient.
C.  There's so much I'm already capable of, why put myself through the frustration stage of coding when I have tools that are prebuolt by geeks thinking about my same ideas.

Ughhh
Jk man
Don't listen to your friends, I mean don't take there negetive comments
Find what's good inside them that they can teach you or they can give you 
If nothing is there
Then forget them, make Google, yt, etc. your teacher and learn stuff by yourself. You are already doing great 😀
Keep learning choose any language, no matter
Let me tell you the difference....
If you choose python to learn coding instead of (c/c++) you'll understand coding, all the syntax so fast and also it will make you feel interesting after python you'll advance towards Java then c then CPP but it will take time 🤌
But if you start learning C which is hard but not impossible to learn, you'll get to understand other language's syntax easily which will decrease the timing to learn other languages


""In order to achieve something great, 
 you have to sacrifice something great""

Great which is timing (by my pov)

HTML & CSS is also good. Why I am saying like that 🤦🏻‍♂️, it's not only good you'll need it in competitive programming

And at some point, after a stumble here and there, you'll run.
This applies to anything in life, not just programming.

I advise you to focus on yourself and find a self-centered motivation to learn this skill. Don't motivate yourself by attempting to fit into a group - that is why they have the power to kick you down.

As for your friends... I shouldn't tell you what to do about your relationship with them. But I will say that their actions say that they don't want you to connect with them via their hobby.

In regards to actually learning, I’d say pick a language and get a well reviewed book on the language that guides you through the fundamentals chapter by chapter. After each chapter, give yourself one or two mini projects based on that chapters content. Don’t move onto the next chapter until you can truly understand and comprehend the previous chapter.

Learning to write and work with code is a journey.

If you’re feeling like you’ve plateaued, maybe adjust your approach so that you can learn in some new way.

yh6xn8,my friends put me down for learning how to code,2239,iud62yj,"2 things- and this is somewhat difficult because I don’t know which is the bigger problem here. I’m leaning towards the first one. 

1. Your friends are not supporting you pursuing an interest. Maybe they’re not very good friends. The worst part is it’s a shared interest. If any friend asked me for any help learning to program I would be overjoyed to help them. Your friends sound insecure and whiny. Maybe they keep putting you down to feel better about their own mediocrity. 

Some people think JavaScript is overwhelming because there’s simply too much going on. C is a lower level language and many people learn a lot because there’s the language, compiler, and the machine. Not some convoluted ancient language that’s been chunked up over the years for web development. 

2. Your friends are not paid to tutor you, so don’t ask them for help. Maybe they don’t want to help you.  

But fundamentally, you should ask yourself why are your ‘friends’ not supporting you? Is it because they’re bad friends or have you pestered them too much without putting in enough effort to learn on your own? 

Programming is a consequence of computer science. It’s an amazingly deep field and there’s so much to explore and discover. Imagination seems to be the only limit. You do NOT have to be a brilliant theoretical computer scientist to be able to learn and enjoy programming. 

It’s hard for everyone to learn. It can be extremely rewarding. The only question is are you motivated to learn despite your friends lack of support? What do you wish to accomplish in studying programming? 

I would recommend you not give up due to your friends. Don’t give up because it’s hard, either. And when it’s hard, don’t ask people for help unless they’re somewhat interested In helping you learn. If you need help I can point you towards resources and learning strategies. But you need to set goals and milestones for yourself, and hold yourself accountable. Prove your friends wrong.

As a developer of _any_ capacity, you are _going_ to have times in your career that you feel like a failure, because you just don't understand something.  You are going to feel much like you do when writing this post.

This feeling you have is called ""learning"".  If you don't learn to love it, you are going to have a hard time in the future.

That said, I don't see you describing anything resembling friends.  If they genuinely put you down for those things, they are not friends.  Full stop.

Feeling like a failure because of emotional wanting to be accepted is normal in programming.

Having other people ridicule you for any reason whatsoever is not.

I genuinely think you'll turn out to be a brilliant developer.  Just ignore what they said and find people that actually know what they are talking about.  Those people are few and far between, but they will help out immensely, both as emotional support, and as a learning platform.

Don't give up just because of them.  Learn a bit more and figure out if you really want to do this for the rest of your life, first.",1

Different languages have different pros and cons. Some are easier to learn, but slower to run, others build to tiny executables but have limited capabilities.

Hell, I couldn’t properly write If…else statements for a good 2-3 months while learning everything on my own with YouTube and Udemy. I hated JavaScript and I had periods where I stopped learning it because it’s not intuitive. Nothing came easy for me as I had to sit there and struggle with (what is a callback? functions can return other functions? and more). As you continue to press forward you will learn that if you understand JavaScript, you will understand almost everything needed to make an application. Fancy libraries (React) and frameworks are all made from JavaScript. That’s all I use at work. Again, it’s incredibly difficult, but you can learn it with tons and tons of practice and repetition. I wonder how many of your friends have actual jobs that uses JavaScript because they’ll know that’s it’s not easy, especially reading someone else’s code. I would cut off contact with them and go completely dark and learn as much as I can about JavaScript. Learn to appreciate and love it and it will reward you in the future — at least that’s the mindset I had and helped me break into the industry.

No one who knew what I did and I kept pushing. I self coded for 2-3 years and then went to a coding boot camp for more/solidified learning. JavaScript is hard, it’s stressful, and sometimes I still sit there doing leetcode (algorithm/ data structure type of questions commonly asked in big tech interviews) not knowing why my code is doing what it does sometimes.

Honestly just hearing that type of stuff from people you may care about can be damaging.. you know the saying if you hear something enough times one day you will believe it

If you started programming just because you wanted to fit in with the group and not because you think it's something you actually enjoy, then drop it, it's definitely not worth spending so much time on a single time consuming and challenging hobby just to make conversation and fit in. 

However, if you do genuinely enjoy the process and programming and creating cool stuff, then I'd suggest you either set clear boundaries with your friends about them diminishing your progress and achievements and things you're proud of, or consider finding a more supportive group. 

HTML and CSS are not ""noob"" languages, they're just markup programming languages mainly used for styling the web. If your primary interest in front end website development, you're on the right track. However, if you want to build apps or get into data science and data analysis, then you need another language where you can do that. JavaScript sure is intimidating when starting, and familiarizing yourself with the syntax can take a while and plenttyyyy of practice and patience. 

If you want something that is easier on the eyes with plenty of online resources, I'd suggest you learn the basics with Python because it is more intuitive than other languages. 

Also, you don't need to rely on them for programming questions! Chances are, someone online has encountered a similar problem and someone already answered them. If you really want to take off with programming, one of the most essential skills (even more so than memorizing syntax) is being able to look stuff up online, with Python or JS or any other programming language.

Secondly, I honestly don't think these people care about you.  If they're putting you down, you need to have a come to Jesus moment and ask them if they consider themselves your friends. Tell them that you're learning this as a way of enriching yourself and bringing you closer to your friend group and that you could use encouragement rather than their constant shitting on your efforts.  

Now, unless this is some established dynamic you have with your friends where you take turns shitting on each other as a joke (this is certainly something I have encountered, though many would say it's toxic regardless), I would say that you should not accept them saying anything like, ""Oh, you know, we just mess with you cause we're friends."" They need to be willing to change their behavior.  If not...we'll, I'd just stop hanging with them.  Intend on not seeing them anymore, or at the very least, distancing yourself from them in most situations.  You need support and you need friends who are willing toshare their interests with you when you make the effort like this.

Good luck to you.  Please don't let those douchebags deter you.  You're capable.  If you made a web page, it sounds like you can code better than most non-coders.  Whatever you do with that is up to you.  If you enjoy it, keep on doing it.",1

3) JavaScript is a shit language and is hard for me even after 10 years of programming. It's a mess and don't learn that.

4) C is a great first language. That may be the only thing your ""friends"" got right. It's a proper programming language, unlike JavaScript.  I'm really glad my first programming language was C and not JavaScript, because if it was JavaScript I'd never learn programming. JavaScript is screwed up...

I used to host a gaming community in 2012 - 2016. It was the largest CS 1.6 gaming community in the country, and we have 4 other games.

Do you know what? I struggled with LUA (for CS2D) for 4 years while I manage the most innovative CS 1.6 server in the country (we had developers that can code and make new content, I am just the owner that manage schedules at that point, I can't write LUA let alone those AMXX crazy shit).

If you are having trouble after learning for 8 months, I suggest you to get a Bootcamp from Monday to Friday, 9 AM to 6 PM for 4 months. I took a Bootcamp once, now I can write code between programming language (I can write Java, JavaScript/TypeScript, Golang, Python) fairly easy.

What I realize is, the reason that I found LUA hard is because I don't know the concept of ""storing data to a variable, a reference, a value, data type, looping, recursive function, a vector, a matrix, a tensor, routines to see what's the data looks like"". I just did not know what to write, in my mind, everything was an empty space, just a blank paper, with a pen, but you don't know how to write the word.

You need Bootcamp to guide you the basic, and then you are good to go.

Things that helped me understand JavaScript:

1. VS Code with it's documentation when you hover the method. So yeah, download VS Code, download the linter extensions for JavaScript / TypeScript.
2. TypeScript, so I know what's my JavaScript variable / method is. So, go a head and force yourself to write in TypeScript instead of JavaScript.",1

But instead of admitting that, they've chosen to simply project the idea that you are just unable to learn this skill. Real friends wouldn't do this to you.",1

yh6xn8,my friends put me down for learning how to code,2239,iugx4fh,"Let me put my thoughts on the matter here. Firstly I would start with you. You made a webpage without anyone's real guidance. That's pretty sick if you ask me. The motivation that must've taken and shear will. I salute you my friend. Next step would be to up your game a level and learn something procedural, for example C, Python or something like that. I'd go with C to understand types and the harder structures and then feel free to ease up a bit and learn python which is user friendly. You can actually make a game there and that would be nice. Just look for pygame tutorials and you're set. Then there is this sad thing with you losing your motivation and starting to believe your doubts. If you ask me, the worst thing here is that someone else planted the seed for those doubts, because coding is really hard sometimes. You will get stuck here and then, that's pretty normal, you will doubt yourself, question your own intelligence and ask yourself: ""Maybe I'm not meant to do this stuff?"". That's totally normal and every single one of us here have gone through this. We simply don't give a shit, we do not trust our stupid mind and either keep going, or we just do something else in this field until we feel like doing the unpleasant things again. As I said the worst thing is that someone else planted the seed for doubts. Because you can just ignore your mind and keep going, but of your friends keep talking shit like this... Then that's where the real demotivation comes from. I suggest your cut out your ""friends"" cuz they were not friends to begin with. And the reason why they put you down is simple. They are stupid themselves and they envy you for doing something like this with pleasure, because they hated it, their guts hated it, they struggled 10000times harder than you when they learned these things and they are not good in this field and they know it. That's where their behavior comes from, they cannot stand someone who likes learning things they hated, they cannot stand the feeling that they had to go through shit to get where they are and you're having fun doing that. It was hard for them and they lie to themselves that it wasn't by saying those things to you to feel better that they didn't do well. If they struggled at loops back in the days, they struggled hard and to feel better about the fact that someone is doing better than them, they just put him down by saying it was easy where in reality it wasn't. It's just a toxic defense mechanism. They needed acknowledgement and they got none so their need for that sadly turned out this way. They need to elevate their own opinions of themselves by putting you down.They feel threatened by someone like you, who is eager to learn things on his own initiative and is doing well. Keep going, you're the alpha here. And cut those dicks out of your life.",1

""this doesn't make any fucking sense""...
Programming wasn't for me as I wasn't interested enough in it to actually follow through. But thats all it is. The more u do it, the more it makes sense and the more u can apply it in day to day. I dont have the time or the patience for it. If u do then u can absolutely be a good programmer in ANY language. If they're saying ur language of choice is not real programming.... then I would counter and say well none of them are real programming languages apart from machine code.... or they are all languages and be done with it. Yes you can do more with some compared to others but they all have their reasons for existing and have their pros and cons depending on what ur going to apply it to.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zc\_PjbOVh8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zc_PjbOVh8)

But to scale up, I'll tell you my story to encourage you to not give up and even embrace a career in Software Engineering because anybody even if not good at Math can (well of course some will require math but even if you can learn by doing). Computer Science schools make you believe the contrary but it's just because they need to do selection.

Warning : I'm not english native so sorry if my sentences may sound awkward. Here's my story:

My major wasn't Software Engineering but Thermodynamics for Bioengineering which I was interested in and I really didn't sign for Computing. But I didn't know we would have a lot of automation courses (idiot I was since we were meant to work in Industries). I wasn't motivated and didn't even assist the courses because after first one on Dos command line, I got a headache :).  I was almost last at exam (Assembly Language at that time).

I didn't care until I was even threatened to be kicked out of engineering school so I have really to improve at least to get the minimum grade of 10/20 I with 7/20th grade just in front of the last one with 6/20th grade :) Then in a course we were shown a visual method (it's specifically french for real time automation used by big companies like Siemens in Europe but it isn't known out of that area but see at the bottom I am working on a pedagogy based on it) and suddenly I started to grasp programming.

To make things short I went from nearly last grade to first grade at a group project where I was the lead. The coefficient was very big, if you have a very bad grade you can really get kicked out of school: quite life threatening. Until final day students in same class (I think we were like 70) made fun of me loudly in my back so I could hear. Then the Grand Day came and grades were announced publicly: we got best grade (16/20) with another group and professor even proposed to pre-recruit me for a job at his company though I refused because I was more interested in Thermodynamics than in Software per se, in the end It happened that everytime I touched a computer people found I was so good and pushed me to go into Software Engineering that I finally did it so here I am ;)

Because of this personal experience, my passion is now pedagogy and applied cognitive science to teach software and more broadly scientific matters but I'll start with programming first. So I have decided after a long career in Software Engineering to work a tool and method to help anybody to kick off his brain to learn any hard skills.

It's R&D I haven't finished yet (it's very complex from Software Engineering viewpoint: creating parser, code generator, etc.), I'm working alone on it because it's faster not to have explain to others what I have in mind, later I'll opensource then people may help, including people which learned programming because I'm carefull to make code as understandable as possible using that very same tool because it is also meant mid term to become a real engineering tool that visually documents itself.

Nevertheless you can have a narrow preview in some videos like [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RsqOMYU3DA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RsqOMYU3DA)

Indeed. 

But to add just a little more detail for OP to help them understand:

OP: Some “friend” groups like to keep a person around as their punching bag. Basically someone they can put down, bully, make fun of, etc.

They do this because they themselves are insecure and making someone else feel insecure makes them feel better. This is the root of bullying. Behind every bully is an insecure person. 

I’m sorry to say you have fallen into one of these groups and you are that punching bag.

But don’t take it personally. It’s not a reflection of you, it’s a reflection of them.

I never really liked math and was just coasting through my high school and early college math classes just barely scraping by. At some point something hit and I started really liking it after which the process became automatic and went from Zero to hero.

If you're learning the wrong way, it's just not going to work. When I first learned C++ on my own I essentially torrented 20 coding books and had all of them opened up to the same chapter/subject. Learning is a process of decoding encoded information. So with the 20 something resources tuned into the same topic, it was like someone explaining me the same topic in 20 different completely different ways. Ultimately out of the 20 explications, five of them struck a chord and one hit the nail making it click.

If not, people are always needed to fix printers or network issues. 

I've had a lot of starts and stops over the past 20 years. I even tried online bootcamps a couple of times (I was told I could easily do a program part time, but as soon as it started the orientation quietly stated it would be much more than in their ad copy). I think the thing is, is that it takes time. 

I say for right now, put down the educational things and try and brainstorm a thing you think would be fun to build in python. I've been thinking about text adventure games, myself. 

I think about it like this: if I want to become a good carpenter, I'm not going to do it after a year of self study. Not in anyway that would make me employable anyway. And if I'm just learning the physics and the whys of joinery over and over again and never building a table or a boat, it's not going to stick.

One of the two is quite enough.

Two points: Firstly, mostly for other newbies reading this, I'd like to point out that the hours you've put in are not that big and for those who are a bit slower to learn programming, it's a fairly insufficient time. When I was learning to code as a teen I spent whole days trying to learn something and it still took me many years before things started to click properly.

This isn't meant as a criticism against you, but I want everyone reading this to understand that programming can be extremely hard and it can take a lot of time to grasp it even on a basic level.

Secondly and to actually answer the question later in your post, there's definitely lots of stuff in software development and infrastructure that involves lite-weight coding. Some sysadmin stuff is not super heavy on coding, though there still is some of it typically involved and as it is, infra maintenance and upkeep has been involving more and more coding.

But e.g. cloud administrators with limited programming skills are still somewhat in need. You might want to look into e.g. Azure or AWS or Google Cloud certificates and if you could get the basic administrator certs.

A lot of management, accounting, secretary stuff, and so on benefits from strong IT skills and being aware of what programming is even if you can't program yourself.

Then there's IT support stuff but yeah idk if you really want to go there.

Software tester is maybe one option. Often they appreciate technology enthusiasm when looking for candidates.

Point being, unless you have a direct application of program where you need to spin up something novel, you're going to only be learning a small part of the paradigm. I would recommend continuing with the exercism exercises and pushing through the dumbfounded-ness. The classes are great to expose yourself to new paradigms, but it's not going to teach you how to become a fluent programmer/problem solver on your own (just like parroting advanced one liners back to duolingo didn't do squat for my conversational skills!). 

And at the end of the day, while you may not be able to spin up novel solutions on the fly, I do expect that after a year and a half of learning, you're now able to at least read code and understand what it's trying to do. Leverage that to the luddites around you and you will VERY easily find a role as a project manager or QA (as others have said).

Edit - if you're interested in gamedev as a means to learn programming: don't. Gamedev is seriously one of the hardest area of development, and it's too easy to get lost when you don't know exactly what you're doing. PICO-8 is IMO an exception because it's super constrained, and it exists first as a learning tool.",5

It depends on why do you want to learn how to code.

If you do it for a job, think were you may want to go, meet with friends in the field, get feedback and opinions.

My opinion and piece of advice for you:
 I found Web and Mobile easier.
 Dart is a really easy language but you only use it for flutter really.
To build your first webpage (a landing page) feels great, find a video tutorial with complete instructions on how to build something with The technology you want(not necessarily web) to learn and do it, this will always take more than an hour.

Just the set up will take more than an hour.

There are two dominant fields of tech. 

A. Programming / Coding / Software Developer

B. Networking / System Admin / Net Engineer

Both work together very closely. 

Your background leaving programming will help you understand the projects that coders and system administrators must work together with to solve business problems. 

There is no grand wizard coder. 

There is no grand wizard routing switching admin.

Start on a small project,  make a program that reads a text file.  BUT start out with a function in python that just prints some words,  next, google how to capture user input into a variable.  Ok, then Print the variable.  Now enter the directory and print it so you know it’s capturing the variable,

It sounds like that’s what you struggle with. Not every job uses them, so if you don’t like those there are jobs out there that don’t require them. Some developers go an entire career never touching leetcode like problems at work. 

If you want to give coding another shot, I recommend Harvard’s CS50 on EdX. It’s basically intro to computer science and you spend half the class programming in C which kinda forces you to learn what’s going on. Honestly I didn’t understand Python until I learned C and picked up some computer science concepts and algorithms through the class. Now algorithms aren’t terribly difficult once you understand what they’re asking. You get comfortable using modulo operators and other things like. CS50 teaches you that kind of stuff in an applied way so you don’t just watch videos and memorize. You actually learn what’s going on in the stack, memory management, debugging, binary, but wise operations, etc and you do weekly assignments in what’s taught and a final project at the end. 

But it’s not for everyone. I’d say give it a look if you’re interested in that. Computer science doesn’t equal programming, but sometimes you use programming to solve computer science problems. Coding is just a way to get closer to the machine and make a computer do things. It’s fun if you like that kind of stuff, but coding just for a job or coding’s sake will burn you out. You won’t pick up why you’re doing something or when to use something if you’re just trying to memorize coding and you’ll get frustrated.

I’m a solutions consultant. I earn six figures in a technical role but I am not a coder or developer. You essentially design the solution that a developer will build, do technical requirements gathering with the client, present the solution to the client to gather feedback and refine it, etc.

Some reasons to consider it:

* It's a real career, in high demand - it doesn't pay quite as much as software engineering, but it's in the same ballpark.
* It's lower stress than many tech roles. Not many writers carry pagers.
* People can and do get tech writing jobs at big name companies coming from a wide variety of backgrounds and career paths, and at all stages of life. For real. It's much more diverse in gender/age/race/personality/formal education level/etc. than software engineering (though that's not hard).
* It's something you can probably try out in your current role.

Are there things in your complicated IT situation that really, really should be written down? This is a skill that you may be able to practice in your current IT job, that may:

*  Give you an idea if it's going to work for you,
* Make you more valuable in your role by giving you tangible artifacts you can point to when discussing compensation and promotion, and
* Make a good story when applying and interviewing for a tech writing role  - especially if you can legally share things you write.

So, maybe give it a try - whether at work, or connected with one of your side projects. See if it feels right.

I read the title and first thought you don't have to leave the field of IT and could work in Networking. Although I thought maybe if programming is not your thing you also may not like networking because it is a lot of path and logic based. But since you mentioned it and you have a Cisco switch I would say networking. I am a network engineer and I love it. The biggest thing I see is that you have so many things you need to know now and that isn't allowing you to focus at your work. I worked at an MSP once and that was the hardest thing. I had the desire to hyper focus down a path but it really wouldn't have been the right thing to do since there was so much going on that I needed to get up to speed with. Moving to a larger company and doing IT internally has really helped out. Also working for internal IT at a technology focused company helps.

Since you have time I think it is totally possible. I hated school and don't think you need it although it has helped. If you get to a place where you think you need it have your employer pay for it. I went down the Cisco track and got the CCNA then CCNP. I would recommend the same. I would recommend getting the Cisco Press book for the CCNA and getting CBTNuggets for training and the boson practice exams once you have gone through all of the material.

I have honestly really enjoyed programming for making myself a better network engineer. I really do it as a hobby and to be more accurate when making network changes. I think this helps because I already do really well at work and now I have some breathing room to learn new things.

I understand where you are coming from and I have tried other career paths in the past and have gone scorched earth when I was done with them. I guess I would wonder about what made you like programming originally and why and then what did you want to be doing instead when you were programming. When I would stop a different path it was really freeing because I knew there were other things I wanted to do that were almost unrelated. Right now I switch from networking, security, automation, and wireless based on what I want to do with about 3-6 months in between and I really like that.",2

You don't have to know everything that's going on, but by having a basic understanding of code you can more easily understand the problem.

What field can I learn more about without coding?,1051,iu853wo,"I've not read all of the many responses yet, so I'll likely repeat some or all of what other commenters have already said. Just some unsorted thoughts:

When I contrast learning programming today with learning programming in the 1980s (when I did it the first time), the major differences aren't just in the overwhelming amount of material and opinions and distractions, but also in why people want to learn programming and how they go about it.

When I first got into programming, it was for two reasons: it was fun (in a game-like sense) and I needed software that didn't exist or that I couldn't afford. I didn't really do exercises, since I didn't have text books. All I did have was one book for the language, the documentation, and some code from other people (""listings"" printed in monthly paper magazines). Most of it was trial and error, with just a vision of what I wanted. I didn't worry about best practices and optimization, I only tried to make things run.

Now today, people first spend tens of hours watching videos, then they spend a lot of time reading up on what's ""best"", agonizing for days or weeks or months about what language, framework, etc they should learn (and then repeat this step every so often).

During all of this, they barely write any code. They may follow tutorials or do exercises, but they don't have any projects. And I understand why. There is a program or an app for every conceivable purpose just a download away, and what people do manage to dream up tend to be very complex projects, like full-fledged video games. They often don't write tools that they actually use, and even when they try, there's always the thought that they could just download something better, so why bother?

This lack of actual use for programming makes it harder to learn it. People like the idea of programming, but they don't like the process, in part because they feel overwhelmed and bogged down. Or they don't care about creating anything, but they think it's a good way to make money. Maybe even from home. No need for a university degree, they think, all the materials can be found for free. But the focus on ""I want a job"" or ""I want to be good at something and I don't really care what I am good at"" isn't always enough.

Then there are all the other issues. You said you're 42. So you may also deal with some perceived ""time is running out"" pressure, or you look at the ""Am I too old for programming? I just turned 17."" posts and feel defeated. Or you see the 20-somethings talk about their junior position they got six months after starting to learn. There may be some envy in this too. Then in an attempt to get some kind of self-validation, you go to ""competitive"" sites that gamify programming, hoping to at least be successful there. And when that doesn't work either, hopelessness creeps up and well, then you give up. Comparison is poisonous.

On top of all of this, tech is moving very fast today. New things all the time, new frameworks, languages, libraries, major releases, and so on. It's overwhelming, especially in some fields like web dev (which people are drawn to). It sometimes feels like what we learn becomes obsolete faster than we can get the hang of it.

Anyway, I ramble!

The main point I'm trying to make is that programming is much easier to learn if you have a tangible, realistic goal, a project. Something you feel you can do, with learning and stretching, but that is neither utopian nor trivial. Not vague goals like ""I want to be better at this"" or ""I want a job in programming"". Big bonus points if it's something you actually need and would use yourself. Study less and code more.

Reddit, YouTube, tech blogs, Udemy, etc. probably contribute a lot to indecisiveness, over-studying, over-worrying, and not coding enough. Maybe just get a couple of books and work through them, ignoring social media/etc. for a while. Try to work out solutions instead of looking them up, even if they are inefficient or overly verbose and look like ""bad code"".

Don't dwell on what you think you should know, or what other people say you should know or languages you should choose because there are this or that many jobs, and just create stuff that does something. Not these little code snippets, but complete programs or apps (no matter how simple). If UI is too complex yet, do CLI tools.

Not everything is for everyone. If you decide that programming just doesn't work for you, then it's best to dedicate your energy and time to some other skill or activity that you align better with. By the sound of it, you gave it a fair try, and it's okay to cut one's losses. Still, I feel you just burnt yourself out by increasingly trying harder and more forcefully as your frustrations grew, instead of simplifying and re-focusing.",2

The leetcode challenges you describe, such as codewars, are, as I see it, 2 things. A tool and a game. A tool for learning one particular subset of programming skills, the logical algorithmic thinking, in extreme, mostly unrealistic challenges. And a game for people who enjoy that sort of challenge. What I've found to usually be far more effective when trying to learn programming, is picking a project that's useful to you, or interesting. So something like automating a boring task at work, or some cool random thing you've always wanted to make. Or an app you've always thought you had a better way to make. Or a robot to close your window blinds for you. Whatever it is, it should be something you're motivated to do enough that you research as needed to figure it out, learning along the way. And should be enjoyable enough that you do it for a lot more than an hour and a half a day. I'll often spend all day on that sort of project, when I have the free time for it. When you've finished that project, pick something else that interests you similarly, and make that! Let programming or robotics become your hobby before you try to make it into your career. That's what worked for me and several of my students and peers in the past, at least. Hope this helps!",2

I suggest going in with note taking (OneNote, Evernote, obsidian etc), flashcards and spaced rep, diary and journal to capture everything you study. RMS the founder of the FSF actively maintains his notes on the C programming language (for which he wrote a compiler called the gcc).

Programming and software development is a good line of career. After 18 months, it is not working out you say.

How about DevOps skills? Docker, Puppet, Jenkins, git, cloud, etc? They could be closer to the items you listed in what you love. Building systems among one of them. Building and maintaining CI/CD pipelines, software and systems deployment is a highly demanding job that is just as highly fulfilling. It could involve writing programs and scripts occasionally.

Be warned that the depth and the breadth of these things take concerted time and work to scale. And without notes, flashcards, journals, it will be extremely difficult.",2

What field can I learn more about without coding?,1051,iu4jmon,"Programming is more of a mindset than a hard skill to learn. It changes your brain. All programmers are problem solvers but very few problem solvers are programmers. Also I find it interesting that you like Linux but don’t like programming. It is pretty much the same exact thing ( at least if you are using terminal and issuing commands through the cli).   It is very hard to go from reading/learning about programming to actually programming. Since you’ve made your declaration I’m not going to try to convince you to keep trying but I will say programming and hardware/software go hand in hand. When you set down at the cli and issue a command you are programming; just one line at a time. Now put many lines  together then you have a script. Put lots of scripts together then you have a program. A script could be as simple as opening and reading a file  or as complex as opening and ingesting 2 million files and processing them in various ways. Sure it sounds crazy and complex but really it is all about breaking things down in to simple easy steps. What are those easy steps? Variables, loops, if/thens and all of those universal components that computers use to do work. It is easy to get overwhelmed by all of the newest noise. The best thing you could do is focus on one thing. If you like Linux then focus on Bash and look at how you could put together scripts to utilize your computer and make it do work.  Like others have said dev ops is another good area to look into but it can also be overwhelming at times. Just understand that with dev ops you are basically writing scripts to build, change and destroy operating environments. But then again it’s all the same things ; writing commands in a way that a computer can do work.  It’s hard and frustrating but anything worth doing takes time and effort.",1

As others have said DevOps is a good idea. AWS has some good certs for this.

I'd also suggest looking into Networking such as CCNA. There is a YouTuber Network Chuck who covers his journey to getting his network certificates and building a career.

I have a friend who has made a good living as a server administrator though I think DevOps is replacing this role. He also takes on a lot of fiverr/freelance jobs installing/upgrading software like WordPress and it's various plugins/themes for people.

Also being a local IT guy can be good if you are good at fixing computer issues and helping with setting up equipment. This requires being a bit outgoing and probably creating a website and some business cards then going around to many local small businesses and offering to help with their IT services. Some certs like CompTIA.

Another option is to look at some freelance/job posting sites and try to gauge what people are actually looking to hire for.

I want to be clear that I don’t think your experience is anywhere near the older mentality of “ why won’t my computer turn on I guess I must be terrible at this”

But because what you’re saying resonated with me and you so clearly have the technical background for this, I’m really curious:

Do you think it is at all the abstraction of your goals right now?

I saw a lot of people offer you tutoring, different tools and program than what you’re using, etc.

And correct me if I’m wrong, but it seems like the 1.5 hours you’re spending a day on coding is so freaking removed from the rest of your life/work (which you are clearly quite good at).

Sounds like everyone else on here give you some really good directions to running in terms of finding fields that you might enjoy more or be more tied to the work that you already know and enjoy.

But as you start to explore these things, I also wonder if you might get some benefit out of adding more goals to your learning process beyond “understand this curriculum. “

I think one of the only beneficial things about Boot Camps, which I’m not suggesting you do, is that they give you a set period of time and what you have to accomplish a goal, and you have resources towards that goal.

There’s also a community and a pyramid of learning around that goal.

Again, lots of other people gave you better resources on this, but you’ve been breaking down what it would look like to make a portfolio for what you’re interested in, or doing one of those 30 Days of Code challenges might bring you some help here.

 Tamia, I don’t have the technical background, but the fact that you were doing this without much in the way of community, concrete benefit on a day-to-day level, and connection to what you are already good at seems like it makes it really really hard.

I’ve seen many people come and go in this field over my years.  The ones who make it the longest are the ones who remember coding was never supposed to be a “career”.  Learning to code is a skill, more over a means to an end to help accomplish a task that is better suited for computers than people.  Stop thinking about patterns, syntax, data structures and algorithms.  Start thinking about something YOU want to create.  Once you have the what figured out, applying methods from books, lessons, lectures etc to accomplish your task will turn into real world experience AND understanding.

We technologists CAN fit the mold of various programming needs the longer we’re in the field, the one thing the greats all have in common is they never started in the field to become a “coder” they started because of a passion for technology and it sounds like you have that already.

a website,
a social platform
a game / simulator
a robot / industrial machine
a medical device

Ok. So my goal was to build a valuable skill that could come in handy, not only for my day job, but also for the future if I find myself unemployed.  I work in a very technical IT position, but it is not a very common position in the industry. I don't have a single cert. I don't have a diploma or a degree. So I wanted to take an interest in a skill that could keep me employed if I lost my job.  (And where I work.... I might end up out of a job if a certain style of government takes over in my country.)

Therefor I need to get my advice from strangers, And I want to keep a positive attitude.

* A yaml-based ci system - GitHub Actions has a substantial free tier, decent documentation, and a good ecosystem of libraries to string together.
* Kubernetes - you should know how and when to use deployment, statefulset, daemonset, ingress, service, configmap, secret, pvc, and pv.  You can use k3s, minikube, or rancher for a local cluster to practice on.
* Helm - you should know how to write, modify, and deploy helm charts.  Helm is just gotpl on top of yaml, so it's simple, but it is *the* k8s deployment tool in practice.
* Docker - you should know how to use multistage builds, how to structure the layers to improve build time and artifact size, and buildkit features for secret management.
* Basic bash and the Linux terminal - no way around this, but you only have to learn it well enough to script, not to program.
* A few core aws tools - ec2, s3, route53, vpc, rds, and cloud watch are required; lambda, sns/sqs, api gateway, dynamodb, acm, and asm are optional.
* An infrastructure as code (IaC) tool - terraform or cloudformation preferably; ansible is an option, but it's going away.

That's it - that'll get you in, and everything else you can learn as you go.  There is solid documentation for all of these and a million blog posts detailing specific use cases available for free.",136

So you have to know the software front and back to be able to make those decisions. Which takes time. I was lucky to get in where I got, and then busted my butt, got lucky some more. I would advise to not get stuck manual testing indefinitely, and to push yourself to figure it out and don’t say “I don’t know”. Always push to learn more. Moving from application to application to expand your skills and experience. 

Manual testing is a great starting point, but you have to push more to get further in a QA career. Then you could come back to programming or managing, unless you can be the go to senior QA person (at least at my company…). As with anything senior, it takes time.

Maybe look at some learning materials for children? My first experience to algorithms was in grade school when we had to write out the process to make a peanut butter sandwich. Thought it was stupid at the time but I understand why the teacher had us do that since it was a really great way to introduce writing to a computer

I think the internet is great at pulling your focus and driving you to whatever quagmire a company wants to pull you to, so they can keep you there. Playing on someone's insecurities is a great way to sell them an idea and leave once the check clears. (I have also spent years oscillating between one self-help book/newsletter to another) The simple fact is, there is no easy answer or guide. I think that's the tough part.

People often criticize me for this take and I understand why, it might come off as me trying to gatekeep the profession to the few of us who really love it but it's when I see people like you that I know it's something that needs to be said more.

Either way I still think it's never late to find enjoyment in the world of programming. For most people coding only really starts to click after a year or two, and it must be harder as you get older as your brain isn't as flexible. But if you feel like you've had enough then that's fair. Maybe the experience will still be useful to you in some way at some point.

DroneBot Workshop on YouTube. I was like you, pure software is hard at first.

But blending it into hardware you get visible results from simple code which is not only straight forward, it gives you the best kind of base to start from. One rooted in absolute practicality. I had no idea how fun programming an Arduino could be. The code can often be quite simple for many many many projects out there and immediately makes you think... If I just made this, I could turn it into x etc. It's such a practical way to start and it's fun! 

This is by far the most legitimate programming and electrical engineering basics channel I have ever encountered on youtube or anywhere online. It is such a down to earth, slow paced, simple, no frills set of deep dive tutorials that can absolutely boost your confidence in doing some pretty cool stuff in tech. I can't recommend this guy's channel enough.

What field can I learn more about without coding?,1051,iu9ixkz,"I think the issue with trying to nail the fundamentals first is that without context and practical application it is really difficult to retain the material. It’ll be so dry and lifeless, and hard to even properly understand.

Take chess for example. Nobody would say to a beginner that before they can play a game of chess, they must first study openings, the middle game, the end game, then solve chess puzzles, before they can play. Instead, you’d briefly tell the person how the pieces move and then let them play. Eventually they’ll have questions or get curious about strategy or tactics, and that will be the time for more studying within the context of experience gained by playing.

If you google for beginner projects, you’ll find lists with suggestions. As an example, as soon as you know how to get user input and learned control flow statements (if/else), you can write a little high number/low number game (it doesn’t have to be tight code). You’ll need to look up a few things, like how to generate a random number. Once that works, you may decide to store and retrieve previous results (or record statistics, like how often specific numbers were generated), make it prettier, let the user pick a number range, and so on. Every time you don’t know how to do it, you look it up.

Or maybe you want to keep an eye on your calorie intake, track your BMI, etc. Write an app for it. CLI at first, then add a UI. Initially you can save data in a plain text file, and later add database support (SQLite or something equally simple). Basically, something that you can grow and expand, and something that you’d actually use.

People often skip doing things like these because they seem too easy, pointless or not what they really want to do. But doing achievable projects like these avoids the situations where you get this frustrating “bottleneck” feeling where you know a lot, or think you should, but can’t put it together, and then conclude that “I’m too dumb/old/hopeless for this!”.

Fast-forward to how I eventually learned later in life: I had a lot of success from following along with video tutorials and then trying to do the same thing in the video by myself (really challenges what you think you know). My experience with something like codewars (I used leetcode early on) was probably more discouraging than anything so I ended up switching to smaller repeatable projects, and really honed in on specific project based skills.

Leetcode-style sites and even educational sites make the learning process less about you enjoying the act of learning something new, and more about thinking you have to learn x, y, and z to become a programmer.  It's no fun and you have hardly anything to show for all the hard work you put in to learning.

As a person who's done this for a bit, you sound burnt out.  I would give up on the idea of getting a job while programming, and ask yourself one question:

""If I could make anything in the world that would actually be fun or beneficial, what would it be?"" 

Then do it or something that feels similar.  Make sure it's tangible, like a tutorial that gives you an end result and lets you look at it and go, ""I made that!"".  It can be whatever you want as long as you have something to show for your hard work (it's really hard for all of us, even for senior devs)

Get involved in production incidents, understand how you missed things in the test plan, ensure it won’t fail the same way twice.  That’s about as good as I can answer it.

He spent around 250-500hours of quite ineffective work. If we follow Andrew Hubermans ( Stanford neuroscientists) advise. He says at most humans can work effectively around 4 hours a day. And then lose drastically efficiency.

So he was studying for 1hour or so sfter his 8 hour work shift. Which means those 1 hour study sessions didn’t do much.

Anything below 45-60minute work session is not good enough for you to enter deep focus.

So, even with perfect focus. He spent around 250-500 hours of effective learning. Which turns out to be around 2-4 full 24 hour/day workweeks.

I reminisce when I played eu4, I have spent 150 hours ingame and I would lose my campaigns.

Theres a joke in a gaming community about eu4 that you are in tutorial zone until you hit 1444hours.

So, OP may not have had good study time and if he cant figure out a way he shouldn’t throw in the towel, perhaps attempt some lighter entry zone like front end dev or devops where he can do bite sized chunks of learning and if he likes, go back to programming later.",1

Who should be responsible for our NAT/port forwarding, is that the network or security team? Sometimes, it would be the developers themselves either making these changes or at least needing to understand the technologies enough to understand who manages them and what needs to be done to reach ""x"" result. The ""server"" part of the equation has been hidden from the developer, but it hasn't gone away. The developer space has moved more towards containers and such but these servers still need to exist and be configured. If you work for a software company as a software engineer where all services are rendered to users via a cloud solution then good for you. But this is not the case at most companies.

yihhjf,Is it just me or are programming tutorials too bloated?,1048,iuiywca,"I have an issue with ALL programming manuals and videos.

I first learnt programming on the Commodore Vic-20. The manual, an introduction to BASIC was by far the best learning manual I have ever encountered.

It would introduce you to one single command and by the end of that chapter, through examples both instructional and practical, you knew that command inside and out.

After only about 5 chapters, with only that many commands learnt, I was able to program some quite complex things (for a beginner in BASIC).

I wish more courses were like that.",6
yihhjf,Is it just me or are programming tutorials too bloated?,1048,iuk6otc,"So I teach at a university; and write some educational content for a couple of courses. Some thoughts:

I started out teaching intro to programming. There, you at least know everything somebody has been officially taught. You can write content assuming they've never heard of while loops/pointers/etc. Even then, designing content that's the right level of difficulty and which has a good progression is hard.

Then, I started teaching some third year courses. In theory, students in these courses must have either done the undergraduate core, or the postgraduate core. Writing exercises is twice as hard -- I can only assume the intersection of the two bodies of knowledge; AND I've not taken the postgraduate core. 

Now, imagine writing content for an imaginary person you've never met. You don't know what stuff they've learned. Therefore, you can assume nothing. BUT, you can't reteach everything -- so how do you do it? You make guesses, and hope that things you don't explain are easily googlable.

The other thing is how hard it is to write content. I make half my living writing educational content, but when I write something, I have to get it reviewed. The number of typos, unclear paragraphs and bad explainations that turn up are incredible. Its very hard to read something you wrote objectively.

Video production is also much more difficult than writing content. Editing a mistake out, or improving an explaination, adds 10 minutes of filming, editing and cutting per mistake. And many computing professionals aren't editors by training. I've learned editing just because I needed it. Even the best professors at universities who have lots of experience teaching are totally new to digital production.

You mention documentation -- documentation is great because you don't need to tell a story. You are explaining what x does, and if x depends on y, then you just link to y. For bigger concepts, you write a page on that concept.

You don't need to figure out an order of what content should go where. You don't need to struggle to find examples that demonstrate what you want; but that don't use content you haven't covered yet. You don't even need to assume anything about your user -- if they're reading your documentation, they're almost certainly already going to have to understand your tools content anyways.",6

My main issue is when 95% of the video is about something other the focus topic, and the focus topic gets glossed over. I swear I've sat through tutorials where it felt more like a demo for some niche library as opposed to covering a particular built in language feature.

With that said, there is a battle between a precise example being dirty code. Sometimes the simplest example is a bad example as it demonstrates a lot of bad practices, and because it is not how most people would use the feature in the wild. 

I myself like dirty coded examples because I can usually read between the lines and use it properly, but a lot of people may not have enough experience to do that. A lot of people may see how to use something, but not really be sure how to incorporate it in their code. Others may use it, but use it in the dirty example form and write some pretty awful code.

There are a lot of concepts and features that can be written cleanly while being straight to the point, and in those cases, going too far in your tutorial can get confusing. Like if you are doing basic file io, you don't need a massive program.

I think a good example of someone who does it well is IAmTimCorey, he details out everything that is happening and the code is code. Some people will think he explains too much, and that is true if you are intermediate or above, but it all is pretty relevant.",3

If that is true it's because I'm able to put myself in the shoes of the person to whom I'm speaking. Many people simply can't do that. Some of those people record tutorial videos! 

So, for example, years ago I taught someone how the thermostat in a UK central heating system works. The idea is very simple but to this person it seemed like magic. I put myself in that person's shoes and explained it in a way that they could understand (without being condescending!). They had an Aha! moment. You Tube tutorials don't always do this. 

In my experience engineers and programmers are generally terrible at explaining things. They can be frustrating to talk to.

Right now I'm doing The Odin Project course, which is mostly good but every now and then it points us toward a video tutorial or series of them that is just terrible, where the speaker is a windbag and explains stuff poorly.  

On the other hand sometimes I find documentation indecipherable, for example some of the offical web pages for Babel and for Express. In contrast the Webpack site is pretty good.

You just have to put the time in to find an explanation that you like, which can be a pain in the arse. But reflect on what happened in the pre-Internet days and think yourself lucky!

If you were doing an engineering course in 1985, let's say, there were few sources of explanation outside your lecturers, tutors and the few text books on the subject. Today if you get stuck you search the web and YT and there are lots of videos and webpages to look at. Eventually you find what you're looking for. This applies to any subject.

I have just this minute been looking for an explanation of how the Turing-Welchman bombe worked. The Wikipaedia entry is atrociously badly explained. The Bletchley Park YT video I have just watched is just plain wrong in several ways and I'm still not any closer to finding out how those devices functioned. But I'll keep trying and eventually find a good explanation that'll allow me to make a simulated bombe in Javascript/HTML/CSS.

- Anticipating the target audience is fiendishly difficult. Some people will be bored and some will be hopelessly lost no matter how much skill I assume in viewers/readers, and it takes a lot of effort to navigate that well.

- ""Those who can, do - those who can't, teach"". A bit cynical, it's really not worth my time to focus hard on the tutorial content. From both a money and time perspective, it's way more worthwhile to actually build something than to write tutorials.

The only way the video is good, from your perspective, is where it hits the absolute sweet spot between knowledge you know, and knowledge you don't.

And they've got a point because that's probably the most natural way we learn things.

Schooling in general tends to have it backwards: a teacher visits a series of subjects that the students learn contextlessly to then tackle problems they were never primed for. And I think the course creators ape this for lack of a better front-of-mind template.

But that's almost never how things work in the real world, in which you tend to get a problem + context *first*, which then requires some creativity and learning to figure out and solve. Hence why academic performance can feel more like theater than actually being predictive of real world productivity.

So for an example of ""normal"" or okay teaching in other media, decent video game tutorials don't just infodump their mechanics to new players like schools and courses do -- that would be boring, right? Instead they show some of the problems necessitating them upfront *before* giving the player the tools to solve them, like a gap that cannot be crossed without using a double jump or glide item (with a reward you can see on the other side that you want to come back to later ofc), or an enemy that needs to be treated differently to be damaged using a new ability. It's so common as to be a design trope in video games ... now why might that be?",76

This is true, and in my experience it's pretty universal. I mean just think of all the stuff you learned in school that your brain threw out because it never saw a use for any of it?

That sort of rich overview of a topic can only be offered by written text, because of the limits of human cognition (which affects our ability to both form complex, verbal sentences, but also to keep up with them). When you say this to these very ""beginners"", though, many will give you a thousand reasons why they can't/won't read a book.

Besides, not everything can be broken down to fundamental, very easy to understand, levels. How would we even define what ""fundamental"" or ""easy to understand"" mean when we have no way of effectively screening for our audience? ""Fundamental"" to someone who knows what an *object* is, is very different than it is to someone who doesn't even know what a programming language is and why it is used. This is why schools are actually so important because you typically (theoretically at least) cannot learn about a certain kind of abstraction unless you have proven that you understand the abstraction that serves as the foundation to the former abstraction.

I don't think gatekeeping tutorials is necessarily bad, if someone persistently makes misinformed, false claims in their tutorials then I think it's reasonable to say they shouldn't be making them but you need either malice or incredible incompetence before then.

As much as I'd like to advocate for the free marketplace of tutorials, free markets don't work. I think one reason this is true for tutorials is because people don't know how to assess the quality of a tutorial. Take Brackeys for instance- a great channel with a lot of popularity, but none of their tutorials actually teach you how to use Unity. They only ever teach you how to do a specific thing in Unity. This isn't just a thing for video tutorials though, it happens everywhere. But people look at a tutorial that will help them get something done and think it's good but all that tutorial has done is enabled them to avoid learning the foundational concept which would have made the solution obvious in the first place.

This is (I would imagine) why there are so many web developers don't actually know how to code, they just guess by throwing shit together. It's great that so many people can code and that this is an option, but it's added so much complexity and bloat to the webdev world and now 99.9% of the internet is way slower than it should be.

yihhjf,Is it just me or are programming tutorials too bloated?,1048,iumi4l3,"I think the best way to understand teaching is to teach.  People who know programming often don't teach that well.  Examples include

* giving programming exercises that they think are interesting but is very hard
* having students come up with their own projects (to me, esp. at the beginning level, it's a colossally bad idea, but teachers think it's great because they like the creativity, but it leads to people stealing stuff from the Internet, or picking stuff that's way too hard that they never finish or way too easy that doesn't get enough credit).
* spend too much time on syntax and not on programming (not to say, syntax isn't important, because it is).

But the big thing is, even if the teacher is accurate conveying information, the student has to do their part.  They often demand the teacher be interesting and clear and funny and they're falling asleep, and then they have a 2 minute lapse where they didn't hear anything or ask any questions (too embarrassed to say they don't know what's going on) and now they're completely lost.

It's hard to do a tutorial because it's one size fits all.  Maybe one person needs a three hour lecture with lots of hand holding.  Maybe another needs a book which they read and code on their own.  Some people have an incredibly difficult time recalling technical things.  They can remember all their coworkers names, their kids names, what their hobbies are, but tell them about a ternary operator and they forget it the minute they hear it.

You don't get to appreciate the effort it takes to make an OK tutorial until you do it yourself, and someone hates it.  You even care to teach well.  You even have ideas how it *should* be done, but it still doesn't work out, at least, not right away, until you truly understand why people are confused.",1
yihhjf,Is it just me or are programming tutorials too bloated?,1048,iul0xhz,"If you don't know why something is done then just copying what other people do won't help you past a very myopic scale. Just look at enterprise Java code- a bunch of people following a dogma of OOP without understanding why and when it's useful and it makes for even more confusing and un-maintainable code than they would have had to begin with.
Generally when people say to teach people by ""getting them in the habit"" then they're not advocating for learning, they're advocating for dogma, and for such a cerebral activity as programming dogma will almost always be harmful.",3
yihhjf,Is it just me or are programming tutorials too bloated?,1048,iuj6v97,"Neither of those are good. If I want to use a tutorial it's because I want to learn how to do the thing and change it as needed later. What I need to know first in foremost is ""how to do the thing"" and then *later* I can think about how to do it better",-14
yihhjf,Is it just me or are programming tutorials too bloated?,1048,iuj3ufc,"Eh, a little too low now. Though I DO love learning about the intricacies of how things work under the hood.

So like the thing is when I am watching a tutorial, I am always subconsciously thinking ""why are you showing me this?""

Let's say I want to know how to print something to console. The obvious answer is to just make a print statement. But let's say this guy makes a variable and gives it a value and then prints the variable instead of just hard-coding it. 

Assuming I'm an absolute beginner, I would get tripped up by this and ask ""what is that? Why is that there?"" The creator did something they didn't *have* to. They added an extra layer of complexity that wasn't necessary to achieve the goal and thus only serves as fluff and filler.

If you're an absolute beginner and are like me, you will agonise about what he just did and why he did it. It must have been important/relevant for him to put it there so what does it do? Why is it there? Most importantly, does it being there mean that that is the *correct* way to do it? 

In short, stupid over-engineering problems like these cause you to *focus on the wrong thing*. It also gives you the wrong idea. It makes you think that the unnecessarily over-engineered part is absolutely necessary; that without it, your program would break. You don't know why, but he did it and it worked so it must be true.

Instead of just showing you how to do the thing you want to do and letting you add whatever bells and whistles you want yourself afterwards, you end up getting the complete wrong idea about the whole thing, not understanding how it works, and just emulating despite not knowing what you are doing.

I hope that manages to get my point across",19

The tendency to want to understand the *why* is actually a terrible habit if your aim is to be productive, either in a professional environment or a personal one.

Just because it is tough doesn't mean it should be. The more you understand programming the more you should realise the amount of artificial complexity in almost every programming environment. When I'm learning I quite often think ""there's so much stuff here that has nothing to do with the tutorial"" and after sticking with it for long enough I rarely change my mind. For example, a tutorial on how to use Haskell for pragmatists which starts by teaches you Category theory is a bad tutorial. Haskell has about 5 hard yet simple ideas before you can program comfortably in it, and monads aren't even one of them.",2
